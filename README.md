# Gathering Data
### Introduction
Gathering is the first step in the data wrangling process:

- **Gather**
- Assess
- Clean
Depending on the source of your data, and what format it's in, the steps in gathering data vary.

The high-level gathering process:

obtaining data (downloading a file from the internet, scraping a web page, querying an API, etc.)
importing that data into your programming environment (e.g. Jupyter Notebook)
